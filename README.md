# StationSite Radio Management System

StationSite RMS is a React App for maintaining radio station data on the StationSite Platform via the [StationSite API](https://github.com/mxmatthew/stationsite-api) 

The project is in it's very early stages but the intention is to:
- allow internet radio station owners to submit and manage their station on the StationSite Platform
- publish radio schedules
- publish programme information (e.g dj/presenter profiles)
- bring all the data into their own website via a RESTful API

## What is StationSite?
StationSite aims to be an open-source radio player platform which will make online/community radio stations accesible through a single online radio player app.

The aim is to allow station owners to make use of the API to build their own players and sites whilst also maintaining a database of radio stations, however because it is open source, station owners are able to host and manage their own independant StationSite platform.
